# Thabeha — Business Links + QR landing page

This is a tiny static site you can host anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel). It shows a list of social links and a QR code that points to your business URL (configured to https://thabeha.com/).

What I added
- X: https://x.com/thabeha2
- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thabeha2
- Instagram: https://instagram.com/thabehaa
- Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/thabehaa
- WhatsApp: https://wa.me/966598220111 (+966 59 822 0111)

Quick usage
1. Edit `script.js` (config) to:
   - Add or change links, logoUrl, or shareUrl if you want a different landing page URL.
2. Host:
   - GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages on the repository root or `gh-pages` branch.
   - Netlify / Vercel: drag & drop or connect the repo.
   - Any static host that serves `index.html`.
3. Generate a high-res QR for print:
   - The page's "Download QR" produces a PNG suitable for digital uses.
   - For print (business cards/posters) generate an SVG or a larger PNG (1200–2400 px). You can:
     - Use an online QR generator for the final domain (with SVG output).
     - Or modify the QR generation: create an off-screen canvas at larger size and render the QR there before exporting.

Notes about the logo
- I used the site's favicon (https://thabeha.com/favicon.ico) as a fallback logo. If you prefer a different image, provide the URL and I'll update it.

If any changes are needed, tell me and I will update the files.
